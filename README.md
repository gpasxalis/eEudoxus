# eEudoxus

Eudoxus is a greek service that supplies university students in Greece with the required books. However, the current code is just a simulation of the real service.

With the current project the students have the opportunity:

(a) To be fully informed of the provided Textbooks.
(b) To be informed of the nearest bookstores.
(c) To receive the required books and documents as soon as possible.
